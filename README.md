# Signal-Viewer
A multichannel desktop application that views and animate signals and display their spectrogram with multiple options.

We designed and created a GUI using tkinter python that displays and animates signals imported from excel sheets (csv).\
The signal viewer supports the following options:\
1.Up to 3 channels to display signals at once. \
2.Moving along the x and y axis using sliders. \
3.Zooming in and out for better visualization.\
4.Speeding up and down the animation.\
5.Play and Pause the animation.\
6.Hide and show any of the signals.\
7.Show the spectrogram for one of the displayed signals.\
8.Tuning the spectrogram color parameters.\
9.Exporting graph, spectrogram and some statistical data into a PDF file.\
